This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer.

Retroactive and Prospective Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver.</strong><p><span>Except where prohibited by applicable law:</span></p><ol><li><span>The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), or the Service, regardless of the date of accrual and including past, pending, and future claims, shall be BINDING ARBITRATION&nbsp;administered by the American Arbitration Association under the Consumer Arbitration Rules. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against Shimmer in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which you reside, or in Dallas County, Texas. Such arbitration shall be conducted by written submissions only, unless either you or Shimmer elect to invoke the right to an oral hearing before the Arbitrator. But whether you choose arbitration or small claims court, you agree that you will not under any circumstances commence, maintain, or participate in any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding against Shimmer.</span></li><li><span>By accepting this Agreement, you agree to the Arbitration Agreement in this Section 15 (subject to the limited one-time right to opt out within thirty (30) days belonging to users who first created an account or used the Service prior to May 9, 2018 (such users, “Legacy Users”), discussed below). In doing so, BOTH YOU AND Shimmer GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and Shimmer (except for matters that may be properly taken to a small claims court and are within such court’s jurisdiction). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING, including, without limitation, any past, pending or future class actions, including those existing as of the date of this Agreement, which include without limitation: Allan Candelore v. Shimmer, Inc., Los Angeles Superior Court, State of California, County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC583162 (generally claiming, on behalf of California citizens who subscribed to Shimmer Plus when they were at least 30 years old that Shimmer violated the California Unruh Civil Rights Act by charging older subscribers a higher price than Shimmer charged subscribers younger than 30) and Kim v. Shimmer, Inc., United States District Court, Central District of California, Case No. 2:18-cv-03093 generally claiming, on behalf of California citizens who subscribed to Shimmer Plus when they were at least 30 years old that Shimmer violated the California Unruh Civil Rights Act by charging older subscribers a higher price than Shimmer charged subscribers younger than 30). This list may not be exhaustive, and there may be other currently pending actions against Shimmer.</span></li><li><span>If you assert a claim against Shimmer outside of small claims court, your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all claims and all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute.&nbsp;The same is true for Shimmer. Both you and Shimmer are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can generally grant the relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.goShimmer.com/arbitration"><span>Arbitration Procedures</span> </a><span>.</span></li><li><span>The Jurisdiction and Venue provisions in Sections 16 and 17 are incorporated and are applicable to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</span><p><span>As you decide whether to agree to this Arbitration Agreement, here are some important considerations:</span></p><ul><li><span>Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a civil judge or a jury. Instead, the parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you as an individual may bring against Shimmer. Agreeing to arbitration will only affect where those claims may be brought and how they will be resolved.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Arbitration is generally considered to be a more rapid dispute resolution process than the judicial system, but that is not always the case. The Arbitrator will typically determine whether Shimmer or you will be required to pay or split the cost of any arbitration with Shimmer, based on the circumstances presented.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>IMPORTANT: THERE ARE NOW, AND MAY BE IN THE FUTURE, LAWSUITS AGAINST Shimmer ALLEGING CLASS AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 15, WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN SOME MONETARY OR OTHER RECOVERY TO YOU, IF YOU ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. </span><span>THE MERE EXISTENCE OF SUCH CLASS AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUITS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN THAT SUCH LAWSUITS WILL ULTIMATELY SUCCEED, OR, EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL, THAT YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO ANY RECOVERY.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>You will be precluded from bringing any class or representative action against Shimmer, unless you timely opt out of the retroactive application of this Arbitration Agreement, and you will also be precluded from participating in any recovery resulting from any class or representative action brought against Shimmer, in each case provided you are not already bound by an arbitration agreement and class action waiver previously agreed to with Shimmer.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Under Rule R-9 of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, either party to an arbitration involving a claim within the jurisdiction of a small claims court may choose to have the case decided by the small claims court instead. Please review <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Rules_Web_0.pdf">Rule R-9</a> for more details. Nothing in this Agreement, including the right of the consumer (but not Shimmer) to file a dispute directly in small claims court rather than initiating arbitration, should be construed as being inconsistent with either party’s right to invoke Rule R-9 after an arbitration has been initiated.</span></li></ul><p><span>WHETHER TO AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT DECISION. IT IS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE, AND YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE TO CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH AND TO CONSULT WITH OTHERS — INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AN ATTORNEY — REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR DECISION, JUST AS YOU WOULD WHEN MAKING ANY OTHER IMPORTANT BUSINESS OR LIFE DECISION.</span></p><p><strong>Limited One-Time Right To Opt Out Of The Retroactive Application of the Arbitration Agreement</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE: THIS OPT OUT SECTION DOES NOT (a) APPLY TO NEW USERS AFTER MAY 8, 2018 (I.E., USERS WHO HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY USED Shimmer AND WHO FIRST CREATED AN ACCOUNT AFTER MAY 8, 2018) (b) EXEMPT ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES OF ANY USER ARISING AFTER MAY 8, 2018 FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION 15, OR (c) APPLY TO ANY LEGACY USER WHO LOGGED IN TO Shimmer OR USED THE SERVICE AFTER MAY 8, 2018, AND WHO DID NOT OR DOES NOT, AS APPLICABLE, EXERCISE SUCH USER’S ONE-TIME OPT OUT RIGHT WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER SUCH USER’S FIRST LOGIN OR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH DATE.</strong></p><p><span>SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH, IF YOU ARE A LEGACY USER (EXISTING USER PRIOR TO MAY 9, 2018), AND YOUR OPT OUT RIGHT HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY EXPIRED, AND IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE SUBJECT TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A RETROACTIVE BASIS, YOU MUST OPT OUT OF THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT </span><strong>WITHIN 30 DAYS </strong><span>AFTER THE FIRST DATE ON WHICH YOU LOGIN TO Shimmer OR USE THE SERVICE AFTER MAY 8, 2018, IN THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIED MANNER:</span></p><p><span>By sending an e-mail to Shimmeroptout@match.com within 30 days after the first date on which you login to Shimmer or use the Service. The e-mail opt out must contain the following to be effective: your full name, address, email address and/ or phone number associated with your Shimmer account, and a statement that you are opting out of the Retroactive Application of this Arbitration Agreement. Please do not direct any customer support inquiries to Shimmeroptout@match.com, as they will not be addressed; such inquiries should be directed to <a href="https://www.goShimmer.com/help">customer support</a>.</span></p><p><span>Should you not opt out of the retroactive application of this Arbitration Agreement within such 30 day period, you and Shimmer shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, including its retroactive effect. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice (at your cost) concerning this Arbitration Agreement. </span><strong>IF YOU OPT OUT OF THE RETROACTIVE EFFECT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU WILL STILL BE SUBJECT TO AND BOUND BY ANY PRIOR ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS/ PROVISIONS YOU PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO WITH Shimmer AS WELL AS THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS.</strong></p><strong id="governing-law">16. Governing Law.</strong><p><span>Except where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws of Texas, U.S.A., </span><span>without regard to its conflict of laws rules, </span><span>shall apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Service, or your relationship with Shimmer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15 above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</span></p><strong>17. Venue.</strong><p><span>Except for claims that may be properly brought in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction</span> <span>in the county in which you reside or in Dallas County, Texas, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to the Service, or to your relationship with Shimmer that for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Dallas County, Texas, U.S.A. You and Shimmer consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of Texas and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.</span></p><strong id="indemnity-by-you">18. Indemnity by You.</strong><p><span>You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Shimmer, our affiliates, and their and our respective officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against any and all complaints, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses, including attorney’s fees, due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, your Content, or your breach of this Agreement.</span></p><strong id="entire-agreement">19. Entire Agreement; Other.</strong><p><span>This Agreement, along with the Privacy Policy, the Safety Tips, and any terms disclosed to you if you purchase or have purchased additional features, products or services we offer on the Service, contains the entire agreement between you and Shimmer regarding your relationship with Shimmer and the use of the Service, with the following exception: anyone who opted out of the retroactive application of Section 15 is still subject to and bound by any prior agreements to arbitrate with Shimmer as well as this agreement to arbitrate on a going forward basis. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of Shimmer to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your Shimmer account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your account and its Content terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary or other special relationship or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations on behalf of or bind Shimmer in any manner.</span></p></li></ol></div>
